# NICU_fluid-nutrient
The NICU Fluid Management App is designed to assist healthcare providers in calculating and managing fluid, feeding, and nutrient intake for neonates in the NICU.

The feeding agent is a seperate more simple feeding calculator, enter day of life (DOL), gestational age and enteral feeding and it suggests the parenteral feeding.
