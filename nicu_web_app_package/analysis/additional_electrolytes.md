# Additional Electrolytes Analysis

## Potassium (K+) - continued
- Hyperkalemia can result from renal insufficiency, hemolysis, tissue breakdown, acidosis, and pseudohyperaldosteronism
- Hyperkalemia can cause ECG abnormalities (tall and peaked T-waves, QRS widening, low R, absent P-waves) and lead to arrhythmias
- Refer to local protocols for hypo- and hyperkalemia management

## Calcium and Phosphate
- Both calcium and phosphate are important for bone development
- Phosphate is also essential for energy metabolism
- Deficiencies in calcium and phosphate can be partially compensated through bone resorption, but this should be avoided
- When supplementing calcium and phosphate in TPN, concentration must be carefully managed to prevent precipitation
- Too high calcium concentration also increases risk of subcutaneous fat necrosis
- When starting amino acids, it's important to provide sufficient phosphate to prevent refeeding-like syndrome with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia
- This risk is highest in dysmature infants
- Refer to local protocols for calcium, phosphate, and magnesium management

## Magnesium
- Magnesium is necessary for nerve conduction and ion transport
- Plays an important role in DNA replication and transcription
- Essential as a cofactor for various enzyme reactions
- Normal values range between 0.7-1.0 mmol/L
- Higher concentrations may occur if mother received prenatal magnesium sulfate
- Refer to local protocols for calcium, phosphate, and magnesium management

## Vitamins and Trace Elements
- Vitamins play an essential role in cell metabolism
- Recommendation is to supplement both fat-soluble and water-soluble vitamins together with lipids for maximum efficacy
