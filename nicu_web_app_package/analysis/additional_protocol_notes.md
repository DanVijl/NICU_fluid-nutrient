# Additional Protocol Analysis

## Special Clinical Considerations
- In cases of sepsis, critical illness, or hyperglycemia, glucose intake should be temporarily reduced
- For persistent hyperglycemia, insulin administration may be necessary (refer to specific protocol)
- For hyperinsulinism, a higher glucose intake than 12 mg/kg/min may be necessary
- In case of long-term TPN combined with poor oral intake and poor growth, amino acid intake for premature infants can safely be increased to 4 g/kg/day while keeping urea levels within normal range
- Lipid clearance may be reduced in sepsis; monitoring and adjusting IV lipid administration is recommended

## Energy Requirements
- The estimated energy needs for both term and premature infants are lower when exclusively on parenteral nutrition
- This lower energy requirement is due to the intestines not being actively involved in the digestion process
- With exclusive parenteral nutrition, energy requirements are:
  - Base requirement: 95-100 kcal/kg/day
  - For dysmature neonates, neonates with severe BPD, or cardiac conditions: up to 130-140 kcal/kg/day
- Growth target is approximately 20 g/kg/day

## Fluid Requirements
- The body consists largely of water, which is necessary for transporting nutrients and metabolites
- Fluid requirements for neonates are normally determined by:
  - Water excretion through urine, feces, and potential vomiting
  - Water loss through evaporation (insensible loss)
- Insensible loss is higher when the amenorrhea duration is shorter and decreases with age
- Influenced by humidity in the incubator and humidification of respiratory gases
- Required fluid intake in the first days of life must account for:
  - Weight
  - Hydration status
  - Serum sodium levels
  - Urine production
- Phototherapy considerations:
  - Single phototherapy: 10-20 ml/kg/day extra fluid
  - Double phototherapy: up to 30 ml/kg/day extra fluid
