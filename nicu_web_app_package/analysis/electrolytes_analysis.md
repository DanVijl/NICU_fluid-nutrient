# Electrolytes Analysis

## Lipids
- When enteral intake is low, intravenous lipids are necessary to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency
- Fat-soluble vitamins are dissolved in the lipid emulsion
- Lipids provide more calories per weight unit than glucose or amino acids
- ESPHGAN recommends using SMOF lipid solution and avoiding intralipid
- Lipid clearance may be reduced in sepsis; monitoring and adjusting IV lipid administration is recommended

## Electrolytes

### Sodium (Na+)
- Sodium is the most important extracellular cation
- In the first days, the recommendation is to supplement as little sodium as possible (approximately 0-2 mmol/kg/day)
- Hyponatremia should be prevented
- Target sodium levels: 140-145 mmol/L (values above 150 mmol/L should be avoided)
- Sodium helps retain fluid, which can increase circulatory load and potentially affect perinatal adaptations
- After the first few days, sodium requirements increase
- When sodium levels are abnormal, consider:
  - Water deficit or excess
  - Sodium deficit or excess
- Abnormal sodium can cause various clinical symptoms:
  - Apnea
  - Bradycardia
  - Lethargy
  - Hypotonia
  - Convulsions
- Hyponatremia can also lead to poor growth

### Potassium (K+)
- Potassium is the most important intracellular cation
- In the first period, no extra potassium supplementation is needed
- Daily requirement is around 2-3 mmol/kg/day, potentially higher in extremely premature infants
- Hypokalemia is often caused by insufficient intake or losses through renal or gastrointestinal routes
- Symptoms of hypokalemia include:
  - Hypotonia
  - Breathing problems
  - Paralytic ileus
  - ECG abnormalities (QT prolongation, prominent U-wave, flattening or inversion of T-wave)
