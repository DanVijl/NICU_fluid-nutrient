# Enteral Feeding Protocol - Additional Analysis

## Feeding Types
- Breast milk is always the first choice
- Alternative feeding options:
  - Donor milk:
    - For infants with gestational age <30 weeks and/or birth weight <1000g
    - Continue until 32 weeks PMA, if actual weight >1000g
  - Premature formula:
    - For infants with gestational age 30-34 weeks and/or birth weight 1000-2000g
    - When parents object to donor milk ("opt out")
    - After stopping donor milk at PML ≥32 weeks AND actual weight ≥1000g
    - Continue until discharge date or transition to growth pattern
  - Standard formula: for infants with gestational age ≥35 weeks and birth weight ≥2000g

## Breast Milk Fortifier (BMF)
- For infants with gestational age/PML <35 weeks and/or (birth) weight < 2000g, minimum 48 hours old
- Add approximately ~60 mL/kg/d to breast milk (4 g/100 mL = 4%) or donor milk (5 g/100 mL = 5%)
- Continue until discharge date or transition to growth pattern

## Feeding Volume
- Start after birth with 10-30 mL/kg/d enteral feeding (including for extremely premature and/or SGA infants)
- Daily increase of enteral feeding:
  - Birth weight <2500g: 20-30 mL/kg/d (preferably with breast milk/donor milk) up to 160-180 mL/kg/d
  - Birth weight ≥2500g: 10-15 mL per feeding per day up to 150-160 mL/kg/d
