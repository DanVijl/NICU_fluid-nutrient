# Enteral Feeding Protocol Analysis

## Overview
This document (N3 Aanbeveling 2024 Enterale voeding) provides recommendations for enteral feeding in neonates. It was developed by a team of neonatologists from various Dutch medical centers with the goal of creating more uniform treatment protocols across 9 Dutch NICUs.

## Key Recommendations

### Timing of Enteral Feeding
- Start enteral feeding as soon as possible, ideally within 12 hours after birth for all neonates (including extremely premature and/or SGA infants), unless contraindications exist

### Type of Feeding
- Breast milk is always the first choice
- Alternative feeding indications:
  - Donor milk:
    - For infants with gestational age <30 weeks and/or birth weight <1000g
    - Continue until 32 weeks PMA, if actual weight >1000g
  - Premature formula:
    - For infants with gestational age 30-34 weeks and/or birth weight 1000-2000g
    - When parents object to donor milk ("opt out")

## Important Considerations
- The document emphasizes that breast milk always has priority and preference over alternative enteral feeding options
- Specific product names are mentioned only for practical clarity, not as personal preferences of the authors
- When alternatives become available in the market, they will be included in future recommendations
