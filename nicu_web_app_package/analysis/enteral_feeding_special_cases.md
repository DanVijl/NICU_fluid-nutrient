# Enteral Feeding Protocol - Additional Details

## Feeding Frequency
- PML <32 weeks and/or <1750 gram: 12 feedings per 24 hours
- PML ≥32 weeks and ≥1750 gram: 8 feedings per 24 hours

## For Insufficient Growth in Premature Infants (Table 5 and Figure 3)
- Optimize feeding intake to 170-180 mL/kg/d (breast milk up to max. 200 mL/kg/d)
- Gradually increase breast milk/donor milk to max. BMF 5.5 g/100 mL and LCT 1 g (=2 mL)/100 mL
- Concentrate premature formula from 16.9 to 18.6 g/100 mL

## For Fluid Restriction (minimum 135 mL/kg/d)
- Gradually increase breast milk/donor milk to max. BMF 6 g/100 mL and LCT 1.5 g (=3 mL)/100 mL
- Concentrate premature formula to max. 18.6 g/100 mL

## For Stoma, Short Bowel, Cholestasis
- Breast milk/donor milk: max. BMF 5.5 g/100 mL and MCT 1 g (=2 mL)/100 mL
- Premature formula: add MCT 1 g (=2 mL)/100 mL

## Monitoring
- Plasma urea control: Every 1-2 weeks when higher protein intake (BMF in breast milk >4 g/100 mL or in donor milk >5 g/100 mL)
- For urea >7.5 mmol/L (without renal dysfunction or dehydration): Consider reducing protein intake
