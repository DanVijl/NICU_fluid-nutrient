# Nutrient Components Analysis

## Glucose/Carbohydrates
- Glucose concentration in blood is determined by the balance between supply and consumption
- Supply comes from nutrition, infusion fluids, and from gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis
- Premature infants have fewer reserves to draw from compared to term infants, making their glucose needs higher
- Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can have harmful long-term effects
- Blood glucose monitoring is crucial; refer to local protocols for hypo- and hyperglycemia management
- Special considerations:
  - In sepsis or critical illness, glucose intake should be temporarily reduced
  - For persistent hyperglycemia, insulin administration may be necessary
  - For hyperinsulinism, higher glucose intake than 12 mg/kg/min may be necessary

## Amino Acids
- The body needs essential and non-essential amino acids to produce proteins
- Protein synthesis occurs much faster in premature infants than in term neonates
- There's an inverse relationship between gestational age and protein synthesis rate
- For premature infants, it's crucial to start amino acid administration quickly after birth
- Renal excretion of proteins increases as infants get younger
- This explains why premature infants have higher protein requirements than term infants
- Protein synthesis requires significant energy
- Important to ensure adequate carbohydrate and lipid supply alongside amino acids
- Day 1 recommendations: minimum 45-55 kcal/kg/day, increasing to 100-120 kcal/kg/day with minimum of 65 kcal/kg/day
- In cases of long-term TPN with poor oral intake and poor growth, amino acid intake for premature infants can be safely increased to 4 g/kg/day while keeping urea levels within normal range

## Lipids
- When enteral intake is low, intravenous lipids are necessary to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency
- Fat-soluble vitamins are dissolved in the lipid emulsion
- Lipids provide more calories per weight unit than glucose or amino acids
- Lipid clearance may be reduced in sepsis; monitoring and adjusting IV lipid administration is recommended
